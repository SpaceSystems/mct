COMMAND CFS SC_MANAGE_TABLE BIG_ENDIAN "This command signals a need for the host application (SC) to allow cFE Table Services to manage the specified table. For loadable tables, this command indicates that a table update is available. For dump only tables, this command indicates that cFE Table Services wants to dump the table data. In either case, the host application must call the table manage API function so that the pending function can be executed within the context of the host."
